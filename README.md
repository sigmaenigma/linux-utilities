# linux_utilities
A place to put the scripts I google for a lot

# SSH Passwordless Access
Couple scripts in here that allow a user to ssh into a box without their password by enabling a private key authentication method

# Common Packages (common_packages.py)
The purpose of this script is to provide me with a quick way to install many apps. In the future, I'd like to extend this with a Django webapp that would allow you to just follow a prompt. I guess this is technically a 'requirements' file for your entire Ubuntu installation.
